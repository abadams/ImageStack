  Anat's sparse deconvolution implementation from Ben Olson.
  Katarina's Exposure Fusion implementation.

it's not clear which operators consume their arguments and which don't

change all help operators to use pprintf

make some testing scripts

make a distribution script (make a web page?)

write some better examples

write a README for developers 

write a README for users

fix equalize (and therefore histogram match) 

Lightfield sampling goes from 0, 0 to width-1, height-1, whereas image sampling goes from 0.5 0.5 to width-0.5 height-0.5. Make this consistent
